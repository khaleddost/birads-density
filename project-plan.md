# BIRADS Mammogram Classification with MedGemma-4B Project Plan

## Project Overview
Train an AI model to classify mammograms according to their BIRADS breast density score (A, B, C, or D) using Google's MedGemma-4B multimodal model as the base.

## 1. Understanding MedGemma-4B
- **Model capabilities**: Multimodal (vision + text) medical AI model
- **Architecture**: Based on Gemma with vision encoder
- **Advantages**: Pre-trained on medical data, understands medical terminology
- **Fine-tuning approach**: Will need to adapt for specific mammogram â†’ BIRADS classification task

## 2. Data Preparation

### Dataset Requirements
- Mammogram images (DICOM or standard formats)
- BIRADS density labels (A, B, C, D)
- Consider including text reports if available (leverage multimodal nature)

### Data Sources
- **Public Datasets**:
  - CBIS-DDSM
  - INbreast
  - VinDr-Mammo
- May need institutional data for better performance

### Preprocessing Steps
- Standardize image sizes/formats for MedGemma input
- Create instruction-following format for fine-tuning
- DICOM to standard image format conversion
- Normalization and standardization
- Train/validation/test split (70/15/15 recommended)

## 3. Fine-tuning Strategy

### Instruction Tuning Approach
```
Input: [Mammogram Image] + "Classify the breast density according to BIRADS categories."
Output: "BIRADS [A/B/C/D]"
```

### Training Configurations

- Gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
- Mixed precision training
- Class-balanced sampling
- Appropriate loss functions for multi-class classification

## 4. Environment Setup
